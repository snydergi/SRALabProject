Dividing data as follows:
    Combine episodes of each patient/therapist then from each combination:
        Testing: 70% 
        Validation: 20%
        Testing: 10% (Will remain separate for testing each patient/therapist combination separately)

Increasing batch size from 128 to 256 due to the increased size of dataset.
Adding a 0.2 dropout. <<<<< Dropout did nothing because only had one layer in model.
Going back to Adam optimizer this time, but decreasing lr from 0.001 (default) to 0.00001.
