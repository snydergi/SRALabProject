This training utilized:
    - batch size: 256
    - dropout: 0.2 <<<<< Dropout did nothing because only had one layer in model.

    - input_size: 8 (joint positions and velocities)
    - hidden_size: 50
    - num_layers: 1
    - batch_first: True
    - data step: 1
    - epochs: 150
    - lookback: 50
    - Predicts: joint positions
