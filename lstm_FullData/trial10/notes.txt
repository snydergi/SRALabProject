This training utilized:
    - batch size: 256
    - Adam optimizer: lr 0.00001
    - input_size: 8 (joint positions and velocities)
    - hidden_size: 50
    - num_layers: 1
    - batch_first: True
    - data step: 1
    - epochs: 150
    - lookback: 50
    - Predicts: one joint value

Eight of these were trained. One for each joint position and velocity.
The target window was shifted forward 25 steps to make it predict up to 75ms in the future.
